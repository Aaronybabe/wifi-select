*Wifi-select* is a console tool for selecting wireless networks in "real-time"
(in NetworkManager manner). The tool might be convenient to use in Internet
caf√©s or other places you are visiting for the first (and maybe the last) time.
With "wifi-select" you do not need to create a profile for a new network, just
type:

    $ sudo wifi-select wlan0

and choose the network you need. In order not to type "wlan0" every time, you
can set it (or make sure it is already there) in $WIRELESS_INTERFACE in
/etc/conf.d/netcfg

"wifi-select" is currently packaged and available in [community] ArchLinux
repository. To install it, please run:

    # pacman -S wifi-select

wifi-select does the following and nothing more:

* parses `iwlist scan` results and presents the list of networks along with their
  security settings (WPA/WEP/None) and signal quality using "dialog" tool
  
* if a user selects a network with an existing profile -- it uses this profile to
  connect with "netcfg"
  
* if the user selects a new network (which doesn't have a profile yet),
  wifi-select automatically generates new profile with corresponding $SECURITY
  and asks for the key (if needed). It uses DHCP as $IP by default
  
* if a network connection succeeds, profile is saved for later usage

* if a network connection fails, the user is asked whether he/she wants to keep the
  generated profile for further usage (for example to change $IP to static or
  adjust some additional options)
